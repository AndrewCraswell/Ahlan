Ionic App Base
==============

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs --type=ionic1 --cordova
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) repo.

## OneRefuge App
According to UNHCR there are around 5 Million Syrian Refugees in different parts of the world. Transitioning to a new world is always challenging and it becomes more cumbersome when you don’t have any other way to go. These people are coming from the war zone, most of them have seen their kin/friends dying in front of their eyes and now they are in a different country where they don’t know anyone. They could hardly understand the language people speak there, need to get adjusted to the new culture, climate etc and in some time they need to start making a living to pay their bills. With this hack, we want to help make this transition easier for them.

We will be building a cross-platform Ionic mobile app to help guide refugees throughout the journey of integrating including benefits, legal documents, culture, language, and education. We're embracing the opportunity to connect refugees with resources and community of volunteers to empower success.
